Signoretto's, Dian's, Siliotti's and Ruben's node project :)

The error message suggests that the client version used to connect to the MySQL server does not support the authentication protocol requested by the server. Upgrading the MySQL client may solve the issue.

To upgrade the MySQL client, you can try the following steps:

Determine the current version of your MySQL client by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

mysql --version

Visit the MySQL website and download the latest version of the client that matches your operating system.

Install the new version of the MySQL client.

Try connecting to the MySQL server again with the upgraded client.

If upgrading the MySQL client does not solve the issue, you may need to check the authentication settings on the MySQL server and ensure that they are configured correctly.
